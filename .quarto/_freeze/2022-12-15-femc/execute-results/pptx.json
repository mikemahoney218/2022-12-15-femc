However, these changes often happen too slowly for most stakeholders to notice, making it challenging to communicate the long-term impacts of disturbances and management. Visualizations and stakeholder outreach can help to close this gap, but currently most methods for depicting the long-term trajectory of a stand are tailored for expert use and are hard to adapt for a generalist audience.\n\n  This talk describes a new approach for communicating forest change over time to stakeholders, using interactive three-dimensional (3D) and virtual reality (VR) landscape visualizations to depict forests before, during, and following key landscape changes. By providing a concrete visual explanation for what it means for a forest to change, these virtual environments can be powerful tools for communicating the impacts of forest management and natural disturbances over time to a wide variety of stakeholders. As a case study, we demonstrate how these tools can be used to visualize the impacts of beech bark disease on a stand in the central Adirondacks. We also briefly describe how improvements in technology, including the new \"terrainr\" and \"unifir\" R packages, are making the production of virtual environments easier and more reproducible.\nformat: \n  pptx: default\n#    reference-doc: template.pptx\n  revealjs: default\n---\n\n\n\n# About Me\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n- Mike Mahoney\n\n- 3rd Year PhD Student (GPES)\n\n- Based in Cambridge, MA\n\n- Focusing on visualization, VR and ML as ways to think about large-scale systems\n\n- These slides: [mm218.dev/lab2022](https://mm218.dev/lab2022)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://github.com/mikemahoney218.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n::::\n",
